# CSS-Exersice
It is a simple task that consists of four images each image contains a web page with various elements styled using css that we were reqiured to imitate with some ground rules for some of them as foolows:
1. image 1 was a simple page in wich there is a header ad six cells where each one had a border with text and a shadow effect we should imitate.
   
2. image 2 was a page in which it required floating articls basically a five containers in which there is a text inside each one stacked beside one another and in between the first three there is a horizontal cramped article field with text inside, black borders and a scroll bar.

3. image 3 was a simple page with various paragraphs and links inside as well as number of nested lists almost each element with a special Css property to it we're reqiured to imitate but without using classes, id's or internal Css.
   
4. image 4 was an extra task but it was a simple page with two sets of cells beside each other that almost looks like two tetris stacks.
